ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @quantumichele, a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Italy.

I am interested in Health Economics as I think that better patient care and health statuses lie at the interception between data analysis, decision sciences and technological innovation. 

Currently, in my profile you can find the bulk of the R code used to build the model of my MSc thesis
